### About me  
I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at Department of Computer Science and Engineering in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), led by Prof. [Lei Chen](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~leichen/). I obtained my bachelor degree from [South China University of Technology](http://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) in Jul. 2015, and my Ph.D. degree from HKUST in Jun. 2019.


### Research focus  
- Shared mobility, car-hailing, ridesharing. 
- Spatial-temporal data processing. 
- Crowdsourcing,  spatial crowdsourcing.
