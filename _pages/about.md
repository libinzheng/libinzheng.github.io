I am currently an associate professor at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](http://sai.sysu.edu.cn/) in Sun Yat-sen University, and also a member at the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Processing. I received my Ph.D degree at the department of computer science and engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, under supervision of [Prof. Lei Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~leichen/) at the [spatiotemporal research group](https://www.cse.ust.hk/stc/). I obtained my bachelor degree in the innovation class of computer science and technology from South China University of Technology. <br/>
